"""
This is a fully functional do nothing backend to provide a template to
backend writers.  It is fully functional in that you can select it as
a backend with

  import matplotlib
  matplotlib.use('Template')

and your matplotlib scripts will (should!) run without error, though
no output is produced.  This provides a nice starting point for
backend writers because you can selectively implement methods
(draw_rectangle, draw_lines, etc...) and slowly see your figure come
to life w/o having to have a full blown implementation before getting
any results.

Copy this to backend_xxx.py and replace all instances of 'template'
with 'xxx'.  Then implement the class methods and functions below, and
add 'xxx' to the switchyard in matplotlib/backends/__init__.py and
'xxx' to the backends list in the validate_backend methon in
matplotlib/__init__.py and you're off.  You can use your backend with::

  import matplotlib
  matplotlib.use('xxx')
  from pylab import *
  plot([1,2,3])
  show()

matplotlib also supports external backends, so you can place you can
use any module in your PYTHONPATH with the syntax::

  import matplotlib
  matplotlib.use('module://my_backend')

where my_backend.py is your module name.  This syntax is also
recognized in the rc file and in the -d argument in pylab, e.g.,::

  python simple_plot.py -dmodule://my_backend

If your backend implements support for saving figures (i.e. has a print_xyz()
method) you can register it as the default handler for a given file type

  from matplotlib.backend_bases import register_backend
  register_backend('xyz', 'my_backend', 'XYZ File Format')
  ...
  plt.savefig("figure.xyz")

The files that are most relevant to backend_writers are

  matplotlib/backends/backend_your_backend.py
  matplotlib/backend_bases.py
  matplotlib/backends/__init__.py
  matplotlib/__init__.py
  matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py

    The graphics context provides the color, line styles, etc...  See the gtk
    and postscript backends for examples of mapping the graphics context
    attributes (cap styles, join styles, line widths, colors) to a particular
    backend.  In GTK this is done by wrapping a gtk.gdk.GC object and
    forwarding the appropriate calls to it using a dictionary mapping styles
    to gdk constants.  In Postscript, all the work is done by the renderer,
    mapping line styles to postscript calls.

    If it's more appropriate to do the mapping at the renderer level (as in
    the postscript backend), you don't need to override any of the GC methods.
    If it's more appropriate to wrap an instance (as in the GTK backend) and
    do the mapping here, you'll need to override several of the setter
    methods.

    The base GraphicsContext stores colors as a RGB tuple on the unit
    interval, e.g., (0.5, 0.0, 1.0). You may need to map this to colors
    appropriate for your backend.
